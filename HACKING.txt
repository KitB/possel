We're using python 3 because we can. Please don't add python 2 compatibility (unless we really take off and users
actually want that).

IRC library stuff has been moved out into the pircel project, we'll just be a user of that project.

Other libraries we'll use:

* Tornado: async loop for cooperative multitasking, web server for fetch API, *maybe* sockets and websockets support for
           push stuff.
* probably ZeroMQ: Decent comms library with tornado interop built into its python bindings; libraries in so many
                   languages.

Check the issue tracker for outstanding tasks, current general state is:

IRC parsing and modelling in pircel is in a vaguely usable state, needs to start growing with use now, feel free to
write tests or generally poke it until it dies then fix what was broken.

Web API and real time notification in possel is unstarted, I'm (KitB) about to start work on it.

Until it's an issue we're not giving much thought to performance; in particular pircel is fairly synchronous so we'll
spend a lot of time blocking on database bits and bobs. I *do* expect this will need to be addressed.
